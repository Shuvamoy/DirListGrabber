# DirListGrabber

Got a Directory Listing in a website and you are lazy to manually go through each of the contents in the directories?

Simply enter the Domain Name , and the extensions of the file(blank if you want to download all) that you would like to inspect
and this will download them recursively to your machine and then give you a list of the files along with its full path 
which then you can choose for manual inspection.

This is a very simple script, feel free to let me know if you can make it more functional and short.
